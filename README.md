# 2D Permeability Demonstration

This repository contains a demonstration on using the lattice Boltzmann method to calculate the permeability through a sample.

Additionally, we show a simple porosimetry simulation to represent capillary pressure drainage curves and how that can relate to picking a ball size for a labyrinth game.
